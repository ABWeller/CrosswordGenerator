# CrosswordGenerator

A WIP project with the end goal being a program that 
can generate an entire crossword puzzle:

- A grid with modifiable sizing
- "walls" and "blanks" added to the grid in a procedural fashion
- A word database
- Across words added based on "blank" section length
- Down words added based on "blank" length AND intersecting across letters
- Some way to automatically search or generate clues for each word
- Possibly add a way to make a more human readable result or a grid that can be printed out for the user along with the word hint list
